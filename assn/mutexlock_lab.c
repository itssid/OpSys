2. Mutex API Reference, https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-locking/apiref-mutex.html

Mutex locks are available in Linux for protecting critical sections within the kernel. Here, a task must invoke the mutex lock() function prior to entering a critical section and the mutex unlock() function after exiting the critical section. If the mutex lock is unavailable, a task calling mutex lock() is put into a sleep state and is awakened when the lockâ€™s owner invokes mutex unlock().[Ref 1]

POSIX API has methods like pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock. Read man pages to know more about these methods. If man page is not installed, google for man pages OR you may install using the following command:
sudo apt-get install manpages-posix-dev

INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Understand the following code thoroughly. Compile and Run the code using make file given. What problem do you observe? 
2. Now apply mutex locks at appropriate places. Whether problem in 1 gets solved?
3. Record your observations in a text file for submission. In the submitted code, make sure the lock are applied properly in the appropriate places.

ANSWERS : 
1 > The final value of the counter is non deterministic because of race condition

2 > The counter is locked while being incremented. This ensures the correct output.   

3 > It is observed that the usage of locks gives expected output. 
 
IMPORTANT NOTE:
We have reproduced atomic_add function here for you to understand how it is implemented internally. In practice, you will need to simply use the default header provided by the compiler. It is called atomic.h and is normally located in asm folder.
